    </center>
    <p>Hello World! My name is Taylor Singleton. I am a computer science major 
        at Chrleston Southern University. I am 21 years old and have lived in 
        South Carolina for my entire life. I enjoy coding, playing video games, 
        running, watching tv, reading, and playing music. I typically spend 
        most of my weekdays doing homework and studying in the library. On the 
        weekends, I enjoy being with my friends while playing games or 
        watching tv. My favorite restaurant is Chick-Fil-A, and I like to eat 
        there as much as possible. Currently, my favorite game is Rainbow Six: 
        Siege. My favorite color is blue, and my favorite animal is the polar 
        bear.</p>
